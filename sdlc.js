// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
let AnalysisOfRequirements = `A look at what kind of technology and what kind of team the project will need, this includes which stacks, languages, and types of engineers, designers, data analytics.`
let Design = `picking style sizing, look, and software methodologies`
let Implentation = `the process of writing and building the code/ program`
let TestingAndIntegration = `making sure no code is broken, the codes runs as intended, is free of bugs. Then rolling out into exisiting code in order make a seamless user experience.`
let Maintain = `The process of adding necessary features, debugging, and keeping up to date. You will see this illustrated with versions 2.0 and 3.0 etc`
